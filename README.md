- 👋 Hi, my name is Sandeep Rai, I am current student at Columbia Graduate School of arts and sciences, completing my undergraduate degree in Accounting and Finance from the University of Birmingham.
I believe I am tailored to be the neccessary and required multi dimensional finance professional with severly proofed grounding in data science at HSBC and banking deals at PwC. 
My wide range of coverage now being sharpened by the teachings at Columbia University I believe I am asset to be comprehensively versed in technical discipline as well as an operating bridge between non experts in Accounting and Finance and computationally entangled tasks.
- 👀 I’m interested in Alternative asset classes (crypto) as well as traditional finance application, with programming wise being interested in value creation through crawling
- - 🌱 I’m currently learning sorting methods and optimization
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on insight and macro data.
- 📫 How to reach me. My email sandeeprai=@hotmail.com
